# Online Food Delivery Service â€“ FRONTEND

## Introduction
Online delivery service is designed to ease the ordering of food for customers at their comfort zones. It is a platform where customers(users), logistics and restaurant coexist.

## Software development tools
1.	Angular 11.0 (Latest version as at the time of developing this app)

Angular was used to build UI pages/screen in line with underline services coming from Java backend endpoints (Apis).

With respect to BRD documentations, the following UI has to be implemented
1.	Register page
2.	Login page
3.	Adding menu page
4.	Order page
5.	Order details page
6.	Confirmation of payment page
7.	Customer Orders(tracking) page


Due to limited time given I was able to implement register, login and add menu pages couples the fact that I am also currently with company tackling tasks assigned to me.

# Conclusion
Since Angular is a component-based framework, for every component represent each screen with services responsible as interface between backend and UI (components).
